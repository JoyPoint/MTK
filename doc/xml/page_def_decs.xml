    <title>Definitions and Declarations</title>
    <detaileddescription>
<para>Throughout the library, we emphasize the difference between definitions and declarations as explained in: <ulink url="http://www.lurklurk.org/linkers/linkers.html#cfile">http://www.lurklurk.org/linkers/linkers.html#cfile</ulink></para><para>A definition associates a name with an implementation of that name, which could be either data or code (...)</para><para>A declaration tells the C compiler that a definition of something (with a particular name) exists elsewhere in the program, probably in a different C file. (Note that a definition also counts as a declarationâ€”it&apos;s a declaration that also happens to fill in the particular &quot;elsewhere&quot;). </para>    </detaileddescription>
