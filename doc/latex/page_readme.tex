# The Mimetic Methods Toolkit (MTK)

By: **Eduardo J. Sanchez, PhD - esanchez at mail dot sdsu dot edu**

## 1. Description

We define numerical methods that are based on discretizations preserving the
properties of their continuous counterparts to be **mimetic**.

The **Mimetic Methods Toolkit (MTK)** is a C++11 library for mimetic numerical
methods. It is a set of classes for **mimetic interpolation**, **mimetic
quadratures**, and **mimetic finite difference** methods for the **numerical
solution of ordinary and partial differential equations**.

## 2. Dependencies

This README file assumes all of these dependencies are installed in the
following folder:

```
$(HOME)/Libraries/
```

In this version, the MTK optionally uses ATLAS-optimized BLAS and LAPACK
routines for the internal computation on some of the layers. However, ATLAS
requires both BLAS and LAPACK in order to create their optimized distributions.
Therefore, the following dependencies tree arises:

### For Linux:

1. LAPACK - Available from: http://www.netlib.org/lapack/
  1. BLAS - Available from: http://www.netlib.org/blas/

2. GLPK - Available from: https://www.gnu.org/software/glpk/

3. (Optional) ATLAS - Available from: http://math-atlas.sourceforge.net/
  1. LAPACK - Available from: http://www.netlib.org/lapack/
    1. BLAS - Available from: http://www.netlib.org/blas

4. (Optional) Valgrind - Available from: http://valgrind.org/

5. (Optional) Doxygen - Available from http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/

### For OS X:

1. GLPK - Available from: https://www.gnu.org/software/glpk/

## 3. Installation

### PART 1. CONFIGURATION OF THE MAKEFILE.

The following steps are required to build and test the MTK. Please use the
accompanying `Makefile.inc` file, which should provide a solid template to
start with. The following command provides help on the options for make:

```
$ make help
-----
Makefile for the MTK.

Options are:
- all: builds the library, the tests, and examples.
- mtklib: builds the library.
- test: builds the test files.
- example: builds the examples.

- testall: runs all the tests.

- gendoc: generates the documentation for the library.

- clean: cleans all the generated files.
- cleanlib: cleans the generated archive and object files.
- cleantest: cleans the generated tests executables.
- cleanexample: cleans the generated examples executables.
-----
```

### PART 2. BUILD THE LIBRARY.

```
$ make
```

If successful you'll read (before building the tests and examples):
```
----- Library created! Check in /home/ejspeiro/Dropbox/MTK/lib
```
